MANAGING AGENTS:
The client part of the ossec is called agent. In order to send the alerts from the client to central ossec-server, we first need to register the client with the ossec-server. For this we will run "/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents" build-in script. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Run "manage_agents". It will show the following promt:


****************************************
* OSSEC HIDS v2.9.0 Agent manager.     *
* The following options are available: *
****************************************
   (A)dd an agent (A).
   (E)xtract key for an agent (E).
   (L)ist already added agents (L).
   (R)emove an agent (R).
   (Q)uit.
Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q: 

2. Add an agent, by choosing the first option "A". Then suply the host-name of the client you want to register, followed by the ip address of that client and ID (optional). Finally confirm it. Here is the promt:


- Adding a new agent (use '\q' to return to the main menu).
  Please provide the following:
   * A name for the new agent: tesla
   * The IP Address of the new agent: 10.0.18.4
   * An ID for the new agent[002]: 
Agent information:
   ID:002
   Name:tesla
   IP Address:10.0.18.4

Confirm adding it?(y/n): y
Agent added.

3. The next step is to extract the key for the agent we just added. For this press "E". Here is the prompt:

Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q: e

Available agents: 
   ID: 001, Name: ghalib, IP: 10.0.18.5
   ID: 002, Name: tesla, IP: 10.0.18.4
Provide the ID of the agent to extract the key (or '\q' to quit): 002

Agent key information for '002' is: 
MDAyIHRlc2xhIDEwLjuMTguNCBlOGQ1NjE1ZjViYjY5NjBhZTkwMzAwMmQ1YzI0ZDE2ZDFhYTA0YTkyNGY3YjYwOTk3MzMzZTM0NzEyOWU3Mjcy

** Press ENTER to return to the main menu.

4. Now copy this key and run the client side "manage_agents" on the client. Here is the promt.


****************************************
* OSSEC HIDS v2.9.4 Agent manager.     *
* The following options are available: *
****************************************
   (I)mport key from the server (I).
   (Q)uit.
Choose your action: I or Q: i

* Provide the Key generated by the server.
* The best approach is to cut and paste it.
*** OBS: Do not include spaces or new lines.

Paste it here (or '\q' to quit): MDAxIGdoYWxpYiAxMC4wLjE4LjUgNzYxYjAzMjI0NmVmZDVkNTQyODMwYjI0NmJkZjExOWNiY2E3YWMyNGQ1NTUzYTY5NGMyYmI2OTM3NmQ5NzVkOA==

Agent information:
   ID:001
   Name:ghalib
   IP Address:10.0.18.5

Confirm adding it?(y/n): y
Added.
** Press ENTER to return to the main menu.


5. Restart both the ossec-server and the client:

systemctl restart ossec
